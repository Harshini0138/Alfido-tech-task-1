## Overview of the Project

### Project : Data Preprocessing
Clean, normalize, and prepare a dataset for AI modeling using pandas and sklearn.

### Objective
The main objective is to enhance data quality, improve model interpretability, and maximize predictive accuracy by handling inconsistencies, missing values, and irrelevant features before modeling

### Key Activities
Clean data: Remove mistakes, missing values, and repeats.
Normalize: Put numbers on the same scale for fairness.
Prepare: Change columns, create new ones, drop unneeded data.
Split: Divide data for training and testing.

### Technologies Used
pandas: To tidy up and organize the data.
sklearn: For scaling numbers, encoding text, and splitting data

### Key Insights
Clean data makes models smarter and more reliable.
Most model-building work is data prepâ€”about 60%.
Good prep means faster, better, and fairer AI results
